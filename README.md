The project utilizes Spotify's web API to edit the users library and find new songs.

## Roadmap

- Add more functions to spotify client

- Clean and make seperate files for functions ot ma
    make it menu driven

  
## Deployment

You need Python 3.7 or later to run these files.

You also need Spotipy for
 user authentication and OAuth token. You can 
 install Spotipy by running the command:
```bash
  pip install spotipy --upgrade
```
Once installed you need to create an app on Spotify's developer
site under the dashboard menu https://developer.spotify.com/

Copy your Client ID and Client Secret and add them
to your system environemnt variabes with the names:
"SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"
"SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"

Change the playlist id given in the random_songs.py 
file to a playlist id from your own account.

The main file to run is random_songs.py

```bash
  python random_songs.py
```
